      shortDescription: 'npx usage introduces supply chain security risks'
      confidence: HIGH
      help: |
        Using npx to install and run packages introduces significant supply chain security risks for the following reasons:

        1. **Unpinned by default**: Running `npx <package>` fetches the latest release outside of your lockfile. If a malicious version of a package is published  ([example])(https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack), `npx` will install and execute it the next time it is run.  

        2. **Bypasses lockfile guarantees**: Packages executed with npx are not added to your project's package.json or lockfile. As a result, their versions and lockfile integrity hashes are not captured for reproducibility, making builds non-deterministic and harder to audit


        ### Recommended practice
        - Add packages as dependencies or devDependencies in `package.json`.  
        - Use your package manager to install and execute them (e.g., `yarn add <package> --dev` followed by `yarn <package> <command>`).

    message: >-
      Avoid using 'npx' to run packages due to supply chain security risks. Instead, install the package 
      as a dependency / devDependency and invoke it using your package manager to ensure version pinning 
      and reproducibility.
